Michal here, joining the ranks of github after a mechanical engineering bachelor and a 1 year stint
in industrial automation. I'm moving to Munich from Connectiut to start a Master's in Robotics and to put it bluntly I have a ton of catching up to do in coding and computer science theory. Wish me luck!
